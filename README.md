# Installation

To run application locally you need to have `git`, `node.js` and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

## Cloning the repo and installing dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/majkeloess/learnTube
cd learnTube
npm i
```

## Setting up environment variables

Change name of the `.env.example` file, into `.env` .

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_YOUTUBE=<YOUR_YT_API_V3_KEY>

```

If you want to fetch data into app you need to have `YOUR_YT_API_V3_KEY`. You can get it from [Google console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). You'll need to create a new application that utilizes the YouTube v3 API. This process is more involved than the previous steps, so please refer to [documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs) for guidance.

## Running the project

```bash
npx expo start
```

Scan QR code from terminal and open [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) on your device. You have to be connected to the same network as on your computer.
