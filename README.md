## Cloning the repo and installing dependencies

git clone https://github.com/majkeloess/learnTube
cd learnTube
npm i
```

## Setting up environment variables

Change name of the `.env.example` file, into `.env` .

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_YOUTUBE=<YOUR_YT_API_V3_KEY>

```

If you want to fetch data into app you need to have `YOUR_YT_API_V3_KEY`. You can get it from [Google console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). You'll need to create a new application that utilizes the YouTube v3 API. This process is more involved than the previous steps, so please refer to [documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs) for guidance.
